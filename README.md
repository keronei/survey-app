# Survey App

A simple app to do the following:
 - Allow user to log in
 - Download questionnaires(will be used interchangeably with surveys) from server
 - Select a questionnaire and fill
 - Syncs the responses every 15 minutes when network is available.

## To Run
 Here's how to run:
 1. Clone the repo from your editor(Android Studio/ IntelliJ)
    1. `File` -> `New` -> `Project From Version Control`
    2. Input `git@github.com:keronei/survey-app.git` if you have set up `SSH` 
    or `https://github.com/keronei/survey-app.git` if you prefer https(not recommended).
 2. Once complete, it will ask if to trust project, Go ahead and Trust its execution.
 3. No special keys/dependencies, let it sync, then connect a device and run.
 4. Use a phone number with +254xxxxxxxxx and password 1234GYD%$

Let's assume laziness got you unexpectedly, you can try this [debug apk](https://github.com/keronei/survey-app/blob/main/releases/app-debug.apk)(might not be up-to-date).

## Approach

The approach of this app is as follows;
1. Downloads the `json` file containing question definitions.
2. Parses the questionnaires into `QuestionnaireDef` and questions to `QuestionDef`
3. The widgets for various input types are predefined already e.g. `FloatWidget`, you can find this
in app/com.keronei.survey/presentation/ui/views/widgets, which inherits from an abstract Class called `QuestionWidget`
which defines most of the common functions like `saveAnswer`, `createAnswerView`, `getAnswerView`, `setupQuestionLabel` e.t.c.
4. When a user selects a questionnaire to fill, a singleton class `QuestionnaireController` is given the questionnaire to 
process and provide easy access to questions by offering functions such as `getNextQuestion`, `getPreviousQuestion`, `getCurrentEvent`
which returns events like `EVENT_BEGGINING_QUESTIONNAIRE`, `EVENT_QUESTION`, `EVENT_END_QUESTIONNAIRE` which is useful
in determining how to guide the user in providing responses.
5. When the controller returns a question, a `WidgetFactory` class accepts a `QuestionDef` and returns a widget representing 
the question, which can be added to the view.
6. This approach enables re-usability of widgets and robustness in handling questionnaires.
